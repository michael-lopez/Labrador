		<p class="right">If this is your first time owning a dog, the Labrador Retriever won't be a problem for you. These dogs are easier to train than most dogs due to their intelligence. The bad thing about these dogs is that they tend to bark a lot, so if you live in apartment these dogs might not be fore you. That doesnt mean you can't have them even if you live in an apartment. You can always teach them when to bark and when not to bark. These dogs are great around family members. They're very energetic, so if you love to exercise this dog is for you. These dogs are just truly nice, and slso good guard dogs.</p>
